# Todo Application

This is a project for SITE'S Bootcamp. I built a simple Todo application. The system allows the user to enter details of the task she/he is planning to do, and the finish date of that task. To sum up, the system preform all CRUD operations.

The application built to be light, friendly, and appealing to use.
So I would like to thank FreeFrontend.com for the great html/css template which I used in this project and edited it. You can find there website in the References section and explore there amazing templates.
